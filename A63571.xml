            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>His Highneſs Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> being gone off from our Fleet the Nine and twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> with Twenty ſayl of good Ships, and five Fireſhips, to joyn with a Squadron of Ten ſayl more at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> his Grace the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> on the One and thirtieth ſet ſayl for the <hi>Gunfleet,</hi> out of the <hi>Downes,</hi> with Fifty four more, and four Fireſhips, the Wind at N. At Ten of the Clock that Night we Anchored, the <hi>Northforeland</hi> being five Leagues from us, bearing N. W. and by W. there being a freſh Gale at S. W. On Friday the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> at Four in the Morning we weighed and ſtood Northward, until Six in the Morn, when the <hi>Northforelands</hi> bore S. W. by S. ſix Leagues off: The <hi>Briſtol</hi> being then four Leagues in the N. E. of us, made Signal that ſhe diſcovered the Enemies Fleet, and we from Topmaſt-head made Eight or Ten ſayl, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Hollands</hi> Scouts; at Seven a Council of Flag-Officers was called aboard his Grace, where it was reſolved to bear with them, which we did, and at Ten we diſcovered their Fleet, conſiſting of 84 ſayl. At Eleven the Signall was given to draw into a Line of Battel, and at Twelve being one League

               <!-- PDF PAGE 63 -->and half in the Wind of them, we bore up with them; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Anchor then ſeven Leagues from <hi>Oſtend,</hi> cut looſe: All our Fleet bore up upon them, except ſome of the White Squadron, at half hour after One; one of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admirals fired the firſt Gun at the <hi>Clovetree,</hi> and then the fight began, we ſtanding to the S. Eaſtward, a freſh gale of Wind at the S. W. ſo that we could not carry out our Lower Teer, and for fear of the Sands, where we found but fifteen Fathom, we bore up and came to the other Tack; we continued fighting all that day, till about Ten that Night, having fired four of their great Ships, ſunk a Vice-Admiral, and another ſhip: On our ſide Rere-Admiral <hi>Harman</hi> was much diſabled, having two Fireſhips on Board him, but by good fortune cleared himſelf again; ſeveral other of our ſhips, had their Rigging and Sails very much ſhattered, and eſpecially the Admiral (his Courage carrying him foremoſt to all Dangers) to ſuch a degree, as ſhe was forced in the ſight of the Enemy to chop to an Anchor, till ſhe had brought new Sayls to the Yards, the old being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred uſeleſs; which having finiſht by 8. that night, we cut and caſt to the Weſtward; as ſoon as we had gathered way, we tackt and ſtood through the Body of their Fleet, which by 9. we had done, then tackt to the Weſtward again. By this time they had taken from us the <hi>Swiftſure,</hi> the <hi>Seven Oakes,</hi> and <hi>Loyal George,</hi> who ſtaying a little behind, were cut from our Fleet. At Ten a Clock they ſtanding Eaſtward, and we Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parted for that Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, June</hi> 2. at two in the morning, we Tackt, and at three diſcovered their Fleet on our Lee-bow, and at five, 12. ſayl on our Weather-bow, which we ſuppoſed a ſupply, or part of their Fleet which we had ſevered the Night before; at 7. we plyed to the Windward to engage the Enemy afreſh; we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Wind, ſtanding to the Eaſtward, bore up round upon them and ſtood to the Weſtward, they then Tackt and ſtood to the Eaſtward; we then found that we wanted 7. ſayl of good Ships that were gone off diſabled from our Fleet; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we engaged very hotly: At 10 we Tackt to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and fought through the very Body of their Fleet, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101945:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 63 -->fell hard upon the Leeward-moſt part of them: Here one of their Rere-Admirals was burnt by the <hi>Young Prince,</hi> a Fireſhip of ours, and a Vice-Admiral of theirs was boarded by the <hi>Spread-Eagle</hi> fireſhip, but put off again. At this time the Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> Lord <hi>Cavendiſh,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho: Clifford,</hi> as Volunteers, came on Board the <hi>Royall Charles</hi> in a Shallop. At two we Tack'd to the Weſtward, and weathered moſt of them, and drew our Fleet together; the <hi>Spread-Eagle</hi> then ſunk, and many of our Ships being much diſabled in their Maſts, Sailes, and Rigging, they ſtood for <hi>England,</hi> without acquainting the Generall, who ſeeing that, thought good likewiſe to hold our Wind, and make the beſt of our way home, having no more then 28. ſayl of fighting Ships left; which we did, they purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us with 66. Sayl, with a fine Gale at W. S. W. and S. W. here we burnt the <hi>St. Paul,</hi> taking out her men, fearing ſhe ſhould not keep company with us, having many foot of water in Hold. At ſeven at Night they got our Wake, and By Nine came up with moſt of us, the Wind favoring them two or three Points, ſo that they came with a Flown Sheet: At Night it proved calm: By three or four in the Morning a ſmall breeſe of Wind ſprung up at N. E. and at a Council of Flagg-Officers, his Grace the Lord Generall reſolved to draw our Fleet into a Reer-line of Battel, and make a fair Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of it. Here his Grace's accuſtomed and excellent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, as well as his invincible Courage, was eminently ſeen, for, by placing his weak and diſabled Ships before in a Line, and 16. of his greateſt and beſt in a Rank in the Reer, as a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark for them, keeping his own Ship neareſt the Enemy, ſuch of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet that were the beſt ſaylers of them, came firſt in parties upon him, and finding it too hot ſervice to attaque him, ſtaid for the reſt of their Fleet. They came not within ſhot of us till Two of the Clock, when preſently we from Topmaſt-head diſcovered a Fleet, being upon a Weſt by North courſe; we altered ours to Weſt by South, and W. S. W. to edge with them, ſuppoſing them to be the Princes Fleet, as indeed it was. At five we fell foul of the <hi>Galloper,</hi> where the <hi>Royal Prince</hi> was grounded, and the Leeward Tide ſet us ſo far from her, that we could not lie by to relieve her.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101945:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 64 -->On the other ſide, the Dutch fell ſo faſt upon her, and with their Fireſhips threatned the boarding of her, that ſhe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtrike her Flagg for quarter, and ſo yielded, and when the Dutch had taken out the men, they ſet her on fire, fearing we ſhould retake her; for after we had joyned the Princes Fleet, we made up towards them, and they clapt upon a Wind, we following them: The General came to the Prince on board the Royal <hi>James,</hi> and gave His Highneſs an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what had hapned in the Three daies action before, and there it was reſolved by His Highneſs and His Grace, at a Council of the Flagg-Officers to fall upon the Enemy the next morning; and that His Highneſs with his freſh ſquadron ſhould lead the Van.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, June the</hi> 4. At day-break we found the Dutch Fleet was got out of ſight, but we ſtanding a courſe after them, with a Wind at S. S. W. quickly made them, about five Leagues diſtant from us upon the Weather-bow, and by Eight a Clock we came up with them; and they having the Weathergage, put themſelves in a Line to the Windward of us.</p>
            <p>Our Ships then which were a head of Sir <hi>Chr. Mings,</hi> made an eaſie ſail, and when they came within a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance lay by, and the Dutch Fleet having put themſelves in order, we did the like; Sir <hi>C. Mings</hi> Vice-Admiral of the Princes Fleet, with his diviſion led the Van, next His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with His own diviſion followed, and then Sir <hi>Edw. Spragge</hi> his Rere-Admiral; and ſo ſtayed for the reſt of the Fleet which came up in very good order.</p>
            <p>By ſuch time as our whole Fleet was come up, we held cloſe upon a Wind, having our Starboard tacks aboard, the Wind S. W. and the Enemy bearing up to fall into the middle of our Line with part of their Fleet, at which, aſſoon as Sir <hi>C. Mings</hi> had their Wake, he tacked and ſtood in, and then the whole Line tacked in the Wake of him and ſtood in; but Sir <hi>C. Mings</hi> in fighting being put to Leeward, the Prince thought fit to keep the Wind, and ſo led the whole Line through the middle of the Enemy, the General with the reſt of the Fleet following in good order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101945:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 65 -->
And here we cannot omit making reflection upon the Prince, who in this Paſs was environ'd with as many dangers as the Enemy could apply unto him, they raked him Fore and Aft, plyed him on both ſides, and to all that, were juſt clapping two Fireſhips upon him, but two of our Fireſhips that attended the Prince, got betwixt that danger and him, and bravely burnt the bold Aſſaylants; and though His Highneſs received very conſiderable prejudice in that difficult paſſage, in his Maſts and Rigging, yet he anſwered the ſhot they powered on him, with as many cloſe returns, which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my felt and carried away with them: and in that whole day, to ſay no more, the Prince did manifeſt a Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct anſwerable to the other great Actions, which belong to the ſtory of his Life, whereby he gave ſpirit to his Friends, and terror to the Enemy.</p>
            <p>After this Paſs, the Prince being come on the other ſide, and ſtanding out ſo as he could weather the end of their Fleet, part of the Enemy bearing up, and the reſt tacking, he tacked alſo, and his Grace tacking at the ſame time, bore up to the Ships to the Leeward, the Prince following him, and ſo we ſtood along backward and forward, the Enemy being ſome to Leeward, and ſome to Windward of us; which courſe was four times repeated, the Enemy alwayes keeping the greateſt part of their Fleet to the Windward, but ſtill at ſo much diſtance as to be able to reach our Sayls and Rigging with their ſhot, and to keep themſelves out of the reach of our Guns, the only advantage they thought fit to take upon us at that time.</p>
            <p>But the Fourth time we plying them very ſharply with out Leeward Gunns in paſsing, their Windward Ships bore up to the Leeward, to Relieve their Leeward Party, upon which his Highneſs tacked the Fifth time, and with eight or ten Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots got to the Windward of the Enemies whole Fleet, and thinking to bear in upon them, his Main-ſtay, and Main-top-maſt, being terribly ſhaken, came all by the Board.</p>
            <p>His Grace then, with that Part of the Fleet with him, having received in this laſt Paſs two ſhots in his Powder-Room, and ſeveral other in his Main-top-maſt, and Fore-maſt, that diſabled him from Tacking, made up towards the Prince,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101945:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 66 -->and he bearing down likewiſe towards him, ſeeing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my made what Sayl they could, as if they meant to come betwixt us, but they having made that counterfeit, their Admiral on a ſudden fired a Gun, to call in the ſtragling Remains of his Tatter'd Fleet (who were at this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from Eighty four, to under the number of Forty Sayl) and bore away before the Wind towards <hi>Fluſhing.</hi> If now thoſe unhappy ſhots (formerly mentioned) had not diſabled in this laſt Tack, his Highneſs, and his Grace's ſhips, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were in Perſon, from the purſuit of them, and obliged us to return to our Ports, though (as it is plain) Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Sea in this Engagement, we had, in all humane probability, had a total Victory over the Enemy, with the loſs, on our ſide, only of His Majeſty Ship the <hi>Prince,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily ſticking upon the Sands, called, the <hi>Galloper;</hi> that of the <hi>Swiftſure</hi> ſeparating from our Fleet in the beginning of the Fight, and the <hi>Eſſex</hi> intangling her ſelf with the <hi>Bull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
